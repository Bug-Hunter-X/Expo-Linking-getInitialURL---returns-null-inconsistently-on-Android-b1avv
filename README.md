# Expo Linking.getInitialURL() returns null inconsistently on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Linking` API where `getInitialURL()` may return `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened, specifically on certain Android versions.  The issue is inconsistent; it may work on some devices and Android versions but fail on others.

## Reproducing the issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android device (different Android versions are recommended for testing).
3. Open a deep link that should trigger the app.  Observe whether `getInitialURL()` returns the expected URL or `null`.

## Potential causes

- **Android OS version incompatibility:**  The issue seems tied to specific Android OS versions.
- **Timing issues:** Asynchronous operations might not have fully completed before `getInitialURL()` is called.
- **Background processes:**  App behavior in the background could interfere.

## Solution (see bugSolution.js)
The provided solution involves improved error handling and potential workarounds to account for the inconsistent behavior of `getInitialURL()`, ensuring more reliable deep link handling across Android versions.
